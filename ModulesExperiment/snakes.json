            "info": "Like all pit vipers, A. contortrix is generally an ambush predator; it takes up a promising position and waits for suitable prey to arrive. One exception to ambush foraging occurs when copperheads feed on insects such as caterpillars and freshly molted cicadas. When hunting insects, copperheads actively pursue their prey."

            "info": "The massasauga may be totally black but is more commonly gray or tan with rows of black or brown spots on its back and sides. It is a venomous snake, usually secretive and unaggressive, that can deliver a painful but rarely fatal bite. Although not in the name, it is a rattlesnake."

            "info": "Potentially, this is one of North America's most dangerous snakes, due to its long fangs, impressive size, and high venom yield. This is to some degree offset by its relatively mild disposition and long brumation period. Before striking, they often perform a good deal of preliminary rattling and feinting."

            "info": "Prairie rattlesnakes live on the land, but they can sometimes climb in trees or bushes. Some even rest in crevices or caves. They are typically active diurnally in cooler weather and nocturnally during hot weather. This species complex is equipped with powerful venom, using about 20-55 percent of venom in one bite, and will defend themselves if threatened or injured."
